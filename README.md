1.padding problem.
giving padding to main frame, the whole frame height gets bigger.
--> not able to solve the problem by myself so made a #firsttext to solve the top-padding(margin) problem.

any advice will be so helpful.

2.box-shadow.
size and the width od the box shadow is differed from desktop to tablet.
->made a different style for the tablet box-shadow.

*my laptop(and monitor) does not show the perfect design output for the website. so not sure this is working well.

3.button text align.
insize the button, the thext "Log in" is not fully aligned in center.
i added <span> tag to try out some problem, but it did not helped.
